# AiCore Projects
This repository is a collection of AiCore projects that was created as a part of the Data Engineering course offered by AiCore, during which multiple certifications were obtained for each completed project.

- [Hangman game](hangman/) - This project was the first part of the Data Engineering course and Python was used to produce the hangman game along with random module

- [Computer Vision Rock Paper and Scissor game](computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors/) - This project was the second part of the Data Engineering course and in this course it involved using camera to capture the user hand movement and tools and module that were used as follows:
    - Python
    - opencv
    - tensorflow
    - ipykernel
    - numpy module
    - random module
    - keras.models module

- [Multinational Retail Data Centralisation](multinational-retail-data-centralisation/) - This project was the third part of the Data Engineering course and in this course it involved using ETL skill (Extract, Transform & Load). Extracting the data from various data soruces, transforming the data by cleaning and removing unwanted data, and load to .csv file to visualise the data output. Tools that were used for this projects are as follows:

    - numpy module
    - dataframe
    - .csv
    - aws (s3 bucket & api)

- [Pinterest Data Pipeline](pinterest-data-pipeline/) - This was the final project of the Data Engineering course and in this course all the tools and skills that was gained from this course were used for this final project. 
    - Python
    - .yaml
    - Pipeline (ETL) 
    - Databricks
    - AWS (REST API, api, dag, airflow, pysparks, S3 bucket, EC2, Kafka, MSK cluster, Kinesis, boto3)
